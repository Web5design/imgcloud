# imgCloud

imgCloud is an elastic image processing application, which scales by automatically allocating and deallocating resources from a IaaS provider.

The project was built in the context of the IN4392 Cloud Computing course at Delft University of Technology. The final report is available [here](https://github.com/mkrause/imgcloud/blob/master/report/report.pdf).


## Overview

The project consists of two major parts:

* `imgcloud` - the image processing server.
* `server` - the server infrastructure that handles scaling the imgCloud application in the cloud and load balancing the application.


## Running the application

See the [README](https://github.com/mkrause/imgcloud/tree/master/imgcloud) in the `imgcloud` directory.

## Running the front-end server

See the [README](https://github.com/mkrause/imgcloud/tree/master/server) in the `server` directory.
